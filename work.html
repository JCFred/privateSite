              <h4>Content creation</h4>
              <p>In order to maintain our content calendar including weekly blog posts, infographics, videos, and more; I had to immerse myself in the manufacturer's world. I've learned more about their industry and those connected to it than I sometimes care to admit and could bore you for hours explaining it. I believe it's important to know what I'm talking about before I open my mouth, so I set out to become an expert in you and your product.</p>

              <h4>Inbound</h4>
              <p>As someone who grew up online, I wasn't surprised when someone gave a name to how I and my peers preferred to be treated as consumers on the web. Inbound marketing has come natturally to me, as all I really have to do is think about how I myself view websites and content when I'm looking for answers, services, or a product. I aim to stay a pro at this methodology from attracting to delighting, so I stay up to date on the latest from HubSpot, Neil Patel, Marcus Sheridan and others who are blazing the inbound trail.</p>

              <p>I know when a project is outside of my expertise or simply too large to complete on my own. That's where my network of designers, developers, and fellow marketers come in. Living and playing in Denver, CO has it's perks as one of the hotspots for young innovators and promising startups.</p>

              <h4>SEO & PPC</h4>
              <p>Starting at basecamp, I researched, developed, and implemented an SEO strategy that has quadrupled traffic over the past 2 years. I took this B2B manufacturing company from off the radar completely to being in the top 3 for about 100 of their relevant keywords. In three months, without changing the budget, I tripled Safe-T-Cover's clicks on Adwords. Click through rates have grown from .87% to an overall average of 2.52% with the best performing adgroup holding steady above 4%</p>
