              <p>In order to maintain our content calendar including weekly blog posts, infographics, videos, and more; I had to immerse myself in the manufacturer's world. I've learned more about their industry and those connected to it than I sometimes care to admit and could bore you for hours explaining it. I believe it's important to know what I'm talking about before I open my mouth, so I set out to become an expert in you and your product.</p>

              <p>As someone who grew up online, I wasn't surprised when someone gave a name to how I and my peers preferred to be treated as consumers on the web. Inbound marketing has come natturally to me, as all I really have to do is think about how I myself view websites and content when I'm looking for answers, services, or a product. I aim to stay a pro at this methodology from attracting to delighting, so I stay up to date on the latest from HubSpot, Neil Patel, Marcus Sheridan and others who are blazing the inbound trail.</p>

              <p>Starting at basecamp, I researched, developed, and implemented an SEO strategy that has quadrupled traffic over the past 2 years. I took this B2B manufacturing company from off the radar completely to being in the top 3 for about 100 of their relevant keywords. In three months, without changing the budget, I tripled Safe-T-Cover's clicks on Adwords. Click through rates have grown from .87% to an overall average of 2.52% with the best performing adgroup holding steady above 4%</p>
